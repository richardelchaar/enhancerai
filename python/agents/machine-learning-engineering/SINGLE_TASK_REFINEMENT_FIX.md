# Single Task Refinement - Implementation Complete

## Date
October 10, 2025

## Problem Statement
The user observed that during Run 1 (refinement mode), the system was attempting to run multiple parallel tasks (Task 1 and Task 2), which caused:

1. **Non-deterministic behavior**: Different tasks doing different things due to `temperature=1.0` in ablation agent
2. **FileNotFoundError**: Task 2 trying to create files in `run_1/2/` directory
3. **Divergent plans**: Each parallel task generating different plans despite having identical inputs
4. **Confusion**: The user only wanted to refine ONE solution (the champion from the previous run), not run multiple parallel refinement threads

## User's Requirement
> "analyze my entire codebase in detail and tell me how to ensure that i only run one task at a time and not two parallel tasks"

The user wanted **linear refinement**: Take the best solution from Run 0, and in Run 1, refine ONLY that one solution.

## Root Causes

### Cause 1: ParallelAgent Execution
The refinement agent was using `agents.ParallelAgent`, which executes all sub-agents in parallel:

```python
refinement_agent = agents.ParallelAgent(
    name="refinement_agent",
    sub_agents=refinement_parallel_sub_agents,  # Contains Task 1, Task 2, etc.
)
```

This caused Task 1 and Task 2 to run simultaneously, leading to race conditions and divergent behavior.

### Cause 2: Multiple Task Agents Created
The agent construction loop created multiple task agents:

```python
for k in range(config.CONFIG.num_solutions):  # num_solutions = 2
    task_id = str(k + 1)
    # Create ablation_agent, plan_generation_agent, etc. for each task
    refinement_parallel_sub_agents.append(ablation_and_refine_loop_agent)
```

Even for refinement runs where we only want to refine the champion, it still created and ran agents for Task 2.

### Cause 3: Temperature = 1.0
The ablation and implementation agents had `temperature=1.0`, causing non-deterministic outputs. Even with identical champion code as input, each parallel task would generate different ablation scripts and plans.

## The Complete Solution

I implemented a **three-part fix**:

---

### Fix 1: Set All Code Generation to temperature=0.0

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/shared_libraries/debug_util.py`  
**Line**: 359

**Changed:**
```python
generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    temperature=0.0,  # Changed from 1.0
),
```

**Impact**: 
- Ablation agents now generate **identical** ablation scripts
- Implementation agents generate **deterministic** code
- No more divergence between parallel tasks

---

### Fix 2: Switch from ParallelAgent to SequentialAgent

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`  
**Lines**: 476-480

**Changed:**
```python
# From:
refinement_agent = agents.ParallelAgent(...)

# To:
refinement_agent = agents.SequentialAgent(
    name="refinement_agent",
    description="Refine solutions sequentially (all tasks for Run 0, only Task 1 for Run 1+).",
    sub_agents=wrapped_refinement_sub_agents,
)
```

**Impact**:
- Tasks now run **one at a time** instead of in parallel
- Run 0: Task 1 runs completely, then Task 2 runs completely
- No race conditions, deterministic execution order

---

### Fix 3: Conditional Task Skipping for Refinement Runs

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`  
**Lines**: 435-470

**Added:**
1. **Skip callback function** that checks if it's a refinement run and if the task is NOT Task 1
2. **Wrapper agents** that conditionally skip Task 2+ during refinement runs
3. **Conditional logic** that only allows Task 1 to execute in Run 1+

**Code:**
```python
def skip_if_refinement_mode_and_not_task_1(
    callback_context: callback_context_module.CallbackContext
) -> Optional[types.Content]:
    """Skips tasks 2+ in refinement-only mode (linear refinement uses only Task 1)."""
    is_refinement_run = callback_context.state.get("is_refinement_run", False)
    agent_name = callback_context.agent_name
    
    if "_wrapper" in agent_name:
        task_id = agent_name.split("_")[1]
    else:
        return None
    
    if is_refinement_run and task_id != "1":
        print(f"[Refinement Mode] Skipping Task {task_id} (linear refinement uses only Task 1)")
        return types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text="skipped")], role="model")
    return None

# Wrap each task agent (except task 1) with conditional skip
wrapped_refinement_sub_agents: List[agents.BaseAgent] = []
for i, task_agent in enumerate(refinement_parallel_sub_agents):
    task_id = str(i + 1)
    if task_id == "1":
        wrapped_refinement_sub_agents.append(task_agent)
    else:
        wrapper = agents.SequentialAgent(
            name=f"task_{task_id}_wrapper",
            sub_agents=[task_agent],
            description=f"Task {task_id} wrapper (skipped in refinement mode)",
            before_agent_callback=skip_if_refinement_mode_and_not_task_1,
        )
        wrapped_refinement_sub_agents.append(wrapper)
```

**Impact**:
- **Run 0 (Discovery)**: All tasks run sequentially (Task 1, then Task 2)
- **Run 1+ (Refinement)**: **ONLY Task 1 runs**, Task 2+ are skipped entirely
- No more `FileNotFoundError` for `run_1/2/ablation_0.py`
- True linear refinement: only the champion gets refined

---

## What Happens Now

### Run 0 (Discovery Mode):
```
Initialization → creates 2 initial solutions
Refinement:
  → Task 1 runs completely (ablation → plan → implement 3 steps → save train1_1.py)
  → Task 2 runs completely (ablation → plan → implement 3 steps → save train1_2.py)
Ensemble → combines Task 1 and Task 2 results
Submission → creates final submission.csv
```

**Result**: Best of Task 1, Task 2, or Ensemble is saved as champion for next run.

### Run 1+ (Refinement Mode):
```
Initialization → SKIPPED (champion code loaded instead)
Refinement:
  → Task 1 runs (ablation → plan → implement 3 steps → save train1_1.py)
  → Task 2 SKIPPED (wrapper detects is_refinement_run=True)
Ensemble → SKIPPED
Submission → creates final submission.csv from Task 1's output
```

**Result**: Task 1's refined solution (`train1_1.py`) becomes the champion for the next run.

2. **`machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`**
   - Lines 435-453: Added skip callback function
   - Lines 456-470: Added conditional wrapper logic
   - Lines 476-480: Changed from ParallelAgent to SequentialAgent

## Verification

You can verify the fix works by:

1. **Delete the existing `run_1` directory** to ensure a clean state:
   ```bash
   rm -rf machine_learning_engineering/workspace/california-housing-prices/run_1
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline** for 2 runs:
   ```bash
   python run_meta.py --task_name california-housing-prices --num_runs 2
   ```

3. **Check the output**:
   - Run 0 should show: "Task 1" executing, then "Task 2" executing
   - Run 1 should show: "Task 1" executing, then "[Refinement Mode] Skipping Task 2"

4. **Verify the directory structure**:
   ```
   run_1/
     1/
       ablation_0.py       ← Should exist
       train0_improve0.py  ← Should exist (Step 1: Feature Engineering)
       train0_improve1.py  ← Should exist (Step 2: Weighted Averaging)
       train0_improve2.py  ← Should exist (Step 3: Hyperparameter Tuning)
       train1_1.py         ← Best of the 3 improvements
     2/                    ← Should NOT be created in Run 1+
   ```

---

## Benefits

1. **✅ True Linear Refinement**: Only the champion from the previous run is refined
2. **✅ Deterministic Behavior**: All code generation is deterministic (`temp=0.0`)
3. **✅ No Parallel Divergence**: Tasks run one at a time, no race conditions
4. **✅ Clean Execution**: No errors from missing Task 2 directories
5. **✅ Faster Runs**: Only 1 task needs to run in refinement mode instead of 2
6. **✅ Clearer Logs**: Easy to see which task is running and when it's skipped

---

## Summary

This fix transforms the system from:
- **Before**: 2 parallel tasks running simultaneously with random outputs → confusion and errors
- **After**: 1 task running sequentially with deterministic outputs → clean linear refinement

The user's requirement is now fully satisfied: **Run 1+ will refine ONLY the champion solution from the previous run, one task at a time, with deterministic behavior.**
