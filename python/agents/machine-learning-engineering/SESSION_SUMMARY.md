# Session Summary: Fixing Run 1 Issues & Indentation Problems

## Overview

This session addressed multiple critical issues that prevented Run 1 (refinement mode) from working properly and tackled persistent indentation errors in ablation scripts.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Run 1 Only Executed 1 Step Instead of 4

**Problem:** Even though plans had 4 steps, only step 0 was executed before the loop terminated.

**Root Cause:** When a plan step failed, the entire plan execution halted due to early termination logic.

**Fix:** Modified `refinement/agent.py` to continue executing remaining steps even if some fail:
- `load_plan_step_for_execution()` - Now logs failures but continues
- `update_plan_execution_step()` - Always advances to next step regardless of current step outcome

**Impact:** All 4 strategic goals will now be attempted, not just the first one.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Wasteful Parallelization (num_solutions = 3)

**Problem:** Enhancer set `num_solutions = 3`, spawning 3 parallel threads all with the same champion code.

**Root Cause:** Enhancer's config overrides were applied without considering linear refinement philosophy.

**Fix:** 
- `run_meta.py` line 116-118: Force `config.CONFIG.num_solutions = 1` at runtime for refinement runs
- Lines 111-113: Reset to proper value for discovery runs

**Impact:** Focused linear refinement on single path, eliminating redundant computation.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ FileNotFoundError: run_1/2/ Directory Not Found

**Problem:** Agents tried to write to `run_1/2/ablation_0.py` but directory didn't exist.

**Root Cause:** Agents constructed at import time with default `num_solutions`, but directories only created for `num_solutions = 1`.

**Fix:** Override `config.CONFIG.num_solutions` before run starts (line 117), so agents dynamically use correct value.

**Impact:** Eliminates FileNotFoundError, ensures agents only access `run_1/1/` directory.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Persistent Indentation Errors in Ablation Scripts

**Problem:** LLM-generated ablation code had frequent indentation errors like:
- Over-indented entire blocks
- Mixed tabs and spaces  
- Code placed outside proper blocks (if outside try)

**Root Cause:** LLMs are probabilistic generators, not copy-paste machines. When copying code 3+ times for ablation variants, indentation drifts.

**Fix:**
- **Installed autopep8:** `poetry add autopep8`
- **Added preprocessing:** `code_util.py` line 58-70 now runs all code through `autopep8.fix_code()` before execution
- **Enhanced prompts:** Added "CRITICAL - Block Structure Rules" to both ablation prompts

**Impact:** 
- ‚úÖ Fixes uniformly over-indented code blocks
- ‚úÖ Converts tabs to spaces automatically
- ‚úÖ Improves PEP 8 compliance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot fix structural errors (code in wrong scope)

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Improved Code Generation Quality

**Problem:** Generated code had syntax errors like `return` outside functions.

**Fix:** Enhanced `IMPLEMENT_PLAN_STEP_INSTR` prompt with explicit requirements:
- Correct indentation (4 spaces, no tabs)
- No `return` outside functions
- No unnecessary function definitions
- Match variable names exactly

**Impact:** Cleaner, more executable generated code.

## Files Modified

### Core Framework Files

1. **`run_meta.py`**
   - Lines 111-113: Reset num_solutions for discovery runs
   - Lines 116-118: Force num_solutions = 1 for refinement runs
   - Line 149: Updated comment (num_solutions already set above)

2. **`machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`**
   - Lines 166-176: Continue on plan step failure instead of halting
   - Lines 196-215: Always advance to next step regardless of outcome

3. **`machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/prompt.py`**
   - Lines 68-73: Added "CRITICAL - Block Structure Rules" to `ABLATION_INSTR`
   - Lines 152-157: Added same rules to `ABLATION_SEQ_INSTR`
   - Lines 307-320: Enhanced `IMPLEMENT_PLAN_STEP_INSTR` with error-prevention guidelines

4. **`machine_learning_engineering/shared_libraries/code_util.py`**
   - Line 7: Added `import autopep8`
   - Lines 58-70: Added autopep8 preprocessing before code execution

### Configuration Files

5. **`pyproject.toml` / `poetry.lock`**
   - Added `autopep8 = "^2.3.2"` dependency

## Expected Behavior in Run 2

With all fixes applied, Run 2 should:

1. ‚úÖ Use only **1 solution thread** (not 3)
2. ‚úÖ Execute **all 4 planned steps** (not just 1):
   - Step 0: Feature engineering
   - Step 1: Hyperparameter tuning (Priority 1!)
   - Step 2: Additional feature engineering
   - Step 3: Ensemble improvements
3. ‚úÖ Continue even if some steps fail
4. ‚úÖ Select best performing step at the end
5. ‚úÖ Have fewer indentation errors due to autopep8
6. ‚úÖ Not crash with FileNotFoundError
7. ‚úÖ Actually improve over Run 0 by implementing hyperparameter tuning

---

## Testing the Fixes

Run the complete pipeline:

```bash
python -m dotenv run -- python run_meta.py --task_name california-housing-prices --num_runs 3
```

**Expected log output for Run 1:**
```
[Run 1] Initializing Linear Refinement Mode
[Run 1] Forcing num_solutions = 1 for linear refinement
[Run 1] Loading champion from: ./machine_learning_engineering/workspace/.../run_0/2/train1_2.py
[Run 1] Created workspace structure and seeded 1 solution(s) with champion code (score: 55858.90)
[Refinement Mode] Skipping initialization_agent_wrapper
INFO: Step 0 for task 1 succeeded - advancing to next step
INFO: Step 1 for task 1 succeeded - advancing to next step
INFO: Step 2 for task 1 succeeded - advancing to next step
INFO: Step 3 for task 1 succeeded - advancing to next step
INFO: Refinement plan for task 1 complete (4 steps executed). Halting loop.
```

## Verification Checklist

After running, verify:
- [ ] Run 1 shows "Forcing num_solutions = 1"
- [ ] Only directory `run_1/1/` exists (not `run_1/2/` or `run_1/3/`)
- [ ] All 4 plan steps are attempted (check logs for "advancing to next step")
- [ ] No FileNotFoundError crashes
- [ ] Ablation scripts have cleaner indentation (check `run_1/1/ablation_0.py`)
- [ ] Final score in Run 1 is different from Run 0 (actual improvement!)
- [ ] `run_history.json` shows Run 1 with a different best_score

## Architecture Lessons Learned

1. **Agent Construction vs Runtime:** ADK agents are constructed at import time but can reference dynamic CONFIG values at runtime.

2. **Linear Refinement Requires Single Thread:** Multiple parallel refinement threads with the same champion is wasteful.

3. **LLM Code Generation Limits:** LLMs struggle with mechanical copy-paste operations; use post-processing (autopep8) as safety net.

4. **Fail-Forward Strategy:** Continue trying remaining strategies even if some fail; select best at the end.

5. **Prompt Layering:** Combine explicit instructions (prompts) with automatic fixing (autopep8) for robust code generation.
