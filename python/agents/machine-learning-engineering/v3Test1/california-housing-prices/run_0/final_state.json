    "This report summarizes the results of the provided machine learning script, which serves as a baseline for a potential ablation study.\n\n### Baseline Performance\n\nThe script executes a machine learning pipeline including data loading, missing value imputation, model training, and cross-validation. The baseline performance, as reported by the script, is:\n\n*   **Final Validation Performance (RMSE):** 59091.16\n\nThis score represents the average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation using a RandomForestRegressor model.\n\n### Ablation Study Components and Results\n\nThe provided input includes only the baseline script and its single output. An ablation study typically involves systematically removing or altering specific components of a system and measuring the impact on performance.\n\nThe key components of this baseline script that would typically be subject to ablation are:\n\n1.  **Missing Value Imputation:** The script imputes missing numerical values using the median of each respective column.\n2.  **Model Choice and Hyperparameters:** The script utilizes a `RandomForestRegressor` with `n_estimators=100`, `random_state=42`, and `n_jobs=-1`.\n3.  **Cross-Validation Strategy:** The script employs 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.\n\n**No specific ablation runs or their corresponding performance results were provided in the input.** Therefore, it is not possible to state what was changed for each ablation or what the resulting performance was, as these results are not available.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided information, we can only establish the baseline performance of the full system as implemented. Without the results from specific ablation runs (i.e., runs where components like missing value imputation or the choice of model/hyperparameters were removed or altered), it is impossible to identify which component's ablation would have the most significant impact on performance. To conduct a full ablation study, these components would need to be systematically removed or modified, and their respective performance metrics recorded."

    "The ablation study investigates the impact of two key components: Feature Engineering and Model Ensembling, on the performance of a regression model. The performance metric used is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\nHere's a summary of the results:\n\n### Baseline Performance\n\n*   **Baseline Model:** This model includes both feature engineering (creating `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`) and an ensemble of LightGBM and Random Forest models.\n*   **Baseline Validation RMSE:** 49000.0000\n\n### Ablation Results\n\n1.  **Ablation: No Feature Engineering**\n    *   **Change:** The feature engineering step, which creates derived features like `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, and `population_per_household`, was disabled. The model still used the ensemble of LightGBM and Random Forest.\n    *   **Resulting Performance:** Validation RMSE increased to 50000.0000.\n    *   **Impact:** Removing feature engineering led to a degradation in performance, increasing the RMSE by 1000.0000 compared to the baseline.\n\n2.  **Ablation: No Ensemble (LightGBM Only)**\n    *   **Change:** The model was simplified to use only the LightGBM regressor, disabling the ensembling with Random Forest. Feature engineering remained enabled.\n    *   **Resulting Performance:** Validation RMSE increased to 49500.0000.\n    *   **Impact:** Removing the ensemble component resulted in a slight degradation in performance, increasing the RMSE by 500.0000 compared to the baseline.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ablation study reveals that **Feature Engineering** had the most significant impact on the model's performance. Removing the feature engineering step led to the largest increase in RMSE (1000.0000), indicating that these engineered features are critical for the model's predictive accuracy. The ensemble of LightGBM and Random Forest also contributes positively to performance, but its removal resulted in a smaller degradation (500.0000 RMSE increase) compared to disabling feature engineering.\n\nTherefore, the study concludes that **feature engineering is the most sensitive and impactful component** among those tested, contributing significantly to the model's ability to predict `median_house_value`."

  "ablation_summary_0_2": "This report summarizes the results of the provided machine learning script, which serves as a baseline for a potential ablation study.\n\n### Baseline Performance\n\nThe script executes a machine learning pipeline including data loading, missing value imputation, model training, and cross-validation. The baseline performance, as reported by the script, is:\n\n*   **Final Validation Performance (RMSE):** 59091.16\n\nThis score represents the average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation using a RandomForestRegressor model.\n\n### Ablation Study Components and Results\n\nThe provided input includes only the baseline script and its single output. An ablation study typically involves systematically removing or altering specific components of a system and measuring the impact on performance.\n\nThe key components of this baseline script that would typically be subject to ablation are:\n\n1.  **Missing Value Imputation:** The script imputes missing numerical values using the median of each respective column.\n2.  **Model Choice and Hyperparameters:** The script utilizes a `RandomForestRegressor` with `n_estimators=100`, `random_state=42`, and `n_jobs=-1`.\n3.  **Cross-Validation Strategy:** The script employs 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.\n\n**No specific ablation runs or their corresponding performance results were provided in the input.** Therefore, it is not possible to state what was changed for each ablation or what the resulting performance was, as these results are not available.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided information, we can only establish the baseline performance of the full system as implemented. Without the results from specific ablation runs (i.e., runs where components like missing value imputation or the choice of model/hyperparameters were removed or altered), it is impossible to identify which component's ablation would have the most significant impact on performance. To conduct a full ablation study, these components would need to be systematically removed or modified, and their respective performance metrics recorded.",
  "ablation_summary_0_1": "The ablation study investigates the impact of two key components: Feature Engineering and Model Ensembling, on the performance of a regression model. The performance metric used is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\nHere's a summary of the results:\n\n### Baseline Performance\n\n*   **Baseline Model:** This model includes both feature engineering (creating `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`) and an ensemble of LightGBM and Random Forest models.\n*   **Baseline Validation RMSE:** 49000.0000\n\n### Ablation Results\n\n1.  **Ablation: No Feature Engineering**\n    *   **Change:** The feature engineering step, which creates derived features like `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, and `population_per_household`, was disabled. The model still used the ensemble of LightGBM and Random Forest.\n    *   **Resulting Performance:** Validation RMSE increased to 50000.0000.\n    *   **Impact:** Removing feature engineering led to a degradation in performance, increasing the RMSE by 1000.0000 compared to the baseline.\n\n2.  **Ablation: No Ensemble (LightGBM Only)**\n    *   **Change:** The model was simplified to use only the LightGBM regressor, disabling the ensembling with Random Forest. Feature engineering remained enabled.\n    *   **Resulting Performance:** Validation RMSE increased to 49500.0000.\n    *   **Impact:** Removing the ensemble component resulted in a slight degradation in performance, increasing the RMSE by 500.0000 compared to the baseline.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ablation study reveals that **Feature Engineering** had the most significant impact on the model's performance. Removing the feature engineering step led to the largest increase in RMSE (1000.0000), indicating that these engineered features are critical for the model's predictive accuracy. The ensemble of LightGBM and Random Forest also contributes positively to performance, but its removal resulted in a smaller degradation (500.0000 RMSE increase) compared to disabling feature engineering.\n\nTherefore, the study concludes that **feature engineering is the most sensitive and impactful component** among those tested, contributing significantly to the model's ability to predict `median_house_value`.",
