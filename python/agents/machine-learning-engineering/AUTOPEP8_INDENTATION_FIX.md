# Autopep8 Indentation Fix Implementation

## What Was Implemented

Added automatic indentation fixing using `autopep8` to the code execution pipeline.

**Files Modified:**
1. `pyproject.toml` / `poetry.lock` - Added autopep8 dependency
2. `machine_learning_engineering/shared_libraries/code_util.py` - Added autopep8 preprocessing

## How It Works

Before executing any generated code, we now run it through `autopep8.fix_code()` with aggressive mode:

```python
code_text = autopep8.fix_code(
    code_text,
    options={
        'aggressive': 2,  # Level 2 aggressive fixes
        'max_line_length': 200,  # Allow longer lines for ML code
    }
)
```

This happens in `run_python_code()` **before** the suppression code is added and **before** the file is saved.

## What Autopep8 CAN Fix ‚úÖ

### 1. **Uniform Over-Indentation** ‚úÖ
When the entire code block is shifted right:

```python
# BEFORE (all lines have 4 extra spaces):
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    X = load_data()
    model.fit(X)

# AFTER (dedented to column 0):
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
X = load_data()
model.fit(X)
```

### 2. **PEP 8 Style Violations** ‚úÖ
- Inconsistent spacing around operators
- Missing blank lines between functions
- Trailing whitespace

---

## What Autopep8 CANNOT Fix ‚ùå

### 1. **Structural Syntax Errors** ‚ùå
Code placed outside proper blocks:

```python
# BEFORE (if statement outside try block):
try:
    if not os.path.exists('./file.csv'):
        print("Creating file...")

if not os.path.exists('./other.csv'):  # ‚ùå Should be inside try!
        print("Creating other file...")
        
    data = pd.read_csv('./file.csv')  # ‚ùå Indented but outside if!
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error")

# AFTER autopep8:
# NO CHANGE - autopep8 can't fix structural errors!
```

This is a **logic error**, not a style error. The LLM put code in the wrong scope.

### 2. **Mixed Indentation at Random Levels** ‚ùå
When code alternates between different indentation levels unpredictably:

```python
# BEFORE:
import pandas as pd
    X = load_data()     # 4 spaces (wrong!)
y = X['target']         # 0 spaces (inconsistent!)
        model.fit(X, y) # 8 spaces (very wrong!)

# AFTER autopep8:
# NO CHANGE or PARTIAL CHANGE - too inconsistent to fix automatically
```

## What This Fixes in Practice

Based on testing, autopep8 will help with:

1. ‚úÖ **LLM over-indenting entire ablation scripts** (common when LLM thinks it's inside a function)
2. ‚úÖ **Consistent style across generated code blocks**
3. ‚úÖ **Minor indentation drift** (e.g., all lines shifted by 2-4 spaces consistently)

**But it won't fix:**
1. ‚ùå **The specific error in your example** (if statement outside try block)
2. ‚ùå **Code in wrong scope/block**
3. ‚ùå **Severely malformed code structure**

---

## For Your Specific Error

Your example has this problem:

```python
try:
    if not os.path.exists('./input/train.csv'):  # ‚úì Inside try
        # ... code ...

if not os.path.exists('./input/test.csv'):      # ‚ùå Outside try!
        # ... code ...
```

**This requires a prompt fix, not a code fix.**

### Recommended Prompt Addition

Add this to `ABLATION_INSTR` and `ABLATION_SEQ_INSTR`:

```
# CRITICAL BLOCK STRUCTURE RULES:
1. If you open a try block, ALL related code must be inside it before the except/finally
2. Do NOT place if statements outside the try block if they should be inside
3. Maintain consistent block structure - every line after "try:" should be indented until "except:"
4. Double-check that your code blocks have consistent scope

WRONG EXAMPLE:
try:
    if condition1:
        do_something()
if condition2:  # ‚ùå WRONG - outside try block!
        do_something_else()
    more_code()  # ‚ùå WRONG - confusing indentation
except:
    pass

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
try:
    if condition1:
        do_something()
    if condition2:  # ‚úì CORRECT - inside try block
        do_something_else()
    more_code()  # ‚úì CORRECT - inside try block
except:
    pass
```

## Testing the Fix

To verify autopep8 is working:

```bash
# Test that autopep8 is installed and working
poetry run python -c "import autopep8; print('‚úì autopep8 loaded')"

# Run your pipeline - any over-indented code will be automatically fixed
python -m dotenv run -- python run_meta.py --task_name california-housing-prices --num_runs 2
```

Check the generated Python files in `machine_learning_engineering/workspace/*/ablation_*.py` - they should have cleaner indentation even if the LLM output was messy.

## Summary

- ‚úÖ **Installed:** autopep8 via Poetry
- ‚úÖ **Integrated:** Into `code_util.py` execution pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Will fix:** Over-indented code blocks, PEP 8 violations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Won't fix:** Structural syntax errors (need prompt improvements)
- üí° **Next step:** Enhance ablation prompts to prevent structural errors

The fix is live and will help reduce indentation errors, but some prompt improvements are still needed for the most severe cases.
