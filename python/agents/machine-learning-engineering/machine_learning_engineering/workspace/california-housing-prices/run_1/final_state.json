The ablation study in `run 0` confirmed that the ensemble approach is critical, as removing XGBoost significantly degraded performance (RMSE increased by 540.6987). Furthermore, applying early stopping to LightGBM during a refinement step led to a direct improvement from 56964.56 to 56571.06, demonstrating the value of regularization. However, early stopping was only partially applied, and other planned improvements like feature engineering and weighted ensembling were not yet executed. The computational budget of 3600 seconds was significantly underutilized (1039 seconds), indicating ample room for further exploration and refinement.",

    "Here is a summary of the ablation study results:\n\n### Ablation Study Summary\n\nThe ablation study aimed to understand the impact of different components on the model's performance, measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n**1. Baseline Performance:**\nThe baseline model, which uses an ensemble of LightGBM and XGBoost models and includes the 'total_bedrooms' feature with median imputation, achieved an RMSE of **56571.0686**.\n\n**2. Ablation 1: Remove Ensembling (use only LightGBM)**\n*   **Change:** The ensembling step, which averaged predictions from LightGBM and XGBoost, was removed. The final prediction was made solely by the LightGBM model.\n*   **Resulting Performance:** The RMSE for this configuration was **56536.3687**. This represents a slight **improvement** in performance compared to the baseline (a decrease in RMSE).\n\n**3. Ablation 2: Remove 'total_bedrooms' feature**\n*   **Change:** The 'total_bedrooms' feature was completely removed from the dataset before training, meaning its imputation step was also effectively removed. The ensembling step remained active.\n*   **Resulting Performance:** The RMSE for this configuration was **56385.1459**. This also represents an **improvement** in performance compared to the baseline.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ablation that had the most significant impact on performance was **Ablation 2: Removing the 'total_bedrooms' feature**. This change resulted in the largest absolute improvement in performance, reducing the RMSE by approximately 185.9227 from the baseline. This indicates that the 'total_bedrooms' feature, or its current handling (median imputation), might be detrimental to the model's predictive accuracy, and its removal leads to a more robust model.\n\nInterestingly, both ablations led to an improvement in performance. Removing ensembling (Ablation 1) also slightly improved the RMSE, suggesting that the XGBoost model might be introducing noise or that the simple averaging ensemble is not optimal for this specific problem, or that LightGBM alone performs slightly better. However, the impact of removing 'total_bedrooms' was more substantial."

  "ablation_summary_0_1": "Here is a summary of the ablation study results:\n\n### Ablation Study Summary\n\nThe ablation study aimed to understand the impact of different components on the model's performance, measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n**1. Baseline Performance:**\nThe baseline model, which uses an ensemble of LightGBM and XGBoost models and includes the 'total_bedrooms' feature with median imputation, achieved an RMSE of **56571.0686**.\n\n**2. Ablation 1: Remove Ensembling (use only LightGBM)**\n*   **Change:** The ensembling step, which averaged predictions from LightGBM and XGBoost, was removed. The final prediction was made solely by the LightGBM model.\n*   **Resulting Performance:** The RMSE for this configuration was **56536.3687**. This represents a slight **improvement** in performance compared to the baseline (a decrease in RMSE).\n\n**3. Ablation 2: Remove 'total_bedrooms' feature**\n*   **Change:** The 'total_bedrooms' feature was completely removed from the dataset before training, meaning its imputation step was also effectively removed. The ensembling step remained active.\n*   **Resulting Performance:** The RMSE for this configuration was **56385.1459**. This also represents an **improvement** in performance compared to the baseline.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ablation that had the most significant impact on performance was **Ablation 2: Removing the 'total_bedrooms' feature**. This change resulted in the largest absolute improvement in performance, reducing the RMSE by approximately 185.9227 from the baseline. This indicates that the 'total_bedrooms' feature, or its current handling (median imputation), might be detrimental to the model's predictive accuracy, and its removal leads to a more robust model.\n\nInterestingly, both ablations led to an improvement in performance. Removing ensembling (Ablation 1) also slightly improved the RMSE, suggesting that the XGBoost model might be introducing noise or that the simple averaging ensemble is not optimal for this specific problem, or that LightGBM alone performs slightly better. However, the impact of removing 'total_bedrooms' was more substantial.",
