  "global_notes": "The previous run successfully identified a strong performing solution (`train_code_improve_1_0_1`) which achieved an RMSE of 40054.36 by implementing advanced feature engineering, outlier handling, scaling, and using a RandomForestRegressor. This significantly outperforms the initial LightGBM/XGBoost ensembles. The main issues were `FileNotFoundError` in the ensemble and submission steps, indicating incorrect file path handling or assumptions about the environment. The next run should focus on building upon this best solution, refining it further, and correctly implementing an ensemble of the best models.",
  "initialization": "The initial models (LightGBM and XGBoost) provided a baseline, but the RandomForestRegressor with advanced preprocessing from `train_code_improve_1_0_1` proved to be much stronger. For the next run, we will not focus on generating new initial models but rather on refining and ensembling the existing best solutions. Ensure all code consistently uses the correct relative path for data loading (e.g., `./input/train.csv`).",
  "refinement": "The `train_code_improve_1_0_1` code block, which achieved an RMSE of 40054.36, should be used as the new baseline for refinement. The next refinement step should focus on:\n1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematically tune the hyperparameters of the `RandomForestRegressor` (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, `max_features`) using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation to find optimal settings. This can be integrated into the existing pipeline.\n2.  **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated feature engineering. Given the geographical nature of the data, consider creating features like 'distance to ocean' (if ocean proximity data is available or can be inferred), or more complex interactions between `latitude`, `longitude`, and `median_income`.\n3.  **Alternative Strong Models:** While RandomForest performed well, consider integrating other strong models like LightGBM or XGBoost into the *same* refined pipeline, applying the same preprocessing steps. This would prepare them for a more robust ensemble in the next phase.",
  "ensemble": "The ensemble strategy needs to be re-evaluated. The previous ensemble attempts either failed due to file path issues or were not combining the best available models effectively. For the next run, the ensemble should combine the best performing models identified so far:\n1.  The refined `RandomForestRegressor` (from the `train_code_improve_1_0_1` pipeline).\n2.  The LightGBM and XGBoost models (which performed well in the initial phase, even if individually weaker than the refined RandomForest).\n\n**Proposed Ensemble Plan (Stacking):**\n1.  **Base Models:** Train the refined `RandomForestRegressor`, a tuned `LightGBM Regressor`, and a tuned `XGBoost Regressor` on the training data. Ensure all models use the same preprocessing (feature engineering, imputation, scaling, outlier handling) as in `train_code_improve_1_0_1`.\n2.  **Out-of-Fold Predictions:** Use K-Fold cross-validation to generate out-of-fold predictions for each base model on the training set. These predictions will serve as features for the meta-learner.\n3.  **Meta-Learner:** Train a simple meta-learner (e.g., `Ridge` or `LinearRegression`) on these out-of-fold predictions. The target for the meta-learner will be the original target variable (`median_house_value`).\n4.  **Test Predictions:** For the final test set predictions, predict with each trained base model, then feed these predictions to the trained meta-learner to get the final ensemble prediction.\n\nEnsure all file loading paths are correct (e.g., `./input/train.csv`).",
  "submission": "The submission code should be updated to reflect the final ensemble model. It must correctly load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files from the `./input` directory, apply all necessary preprocessing steps (imputation, feature engineering, scaling, outlier handling), generate predictions using the trained ensemble model, and save them to `submission.csv` in the specified format. Double-check file paths to avoid `FileNotFoundError`.",
