# Strategy Library: Sophisticated ML Improvements

## Feature Engineering Strategies

### FE-1: Geographic Feature Engineering
Create spatial features: (1) KMeans clustering on lat/long with k=[5,10,20], generate cluster IDs and distance-to-centroid features; (2) Distance to major cities/landmarks if applicable; (3) Spatial density features (points within radius); (4) Grid-based binning of coordinates. Apply all and compare impact.

### FE-2: Polynomial & Interaction Features
Generate polynomial features: (1) Use PolynomialFeatures with degree=2 on top 5 most correlated features; (2) Manually create domain-specific interactions (e.g., income × location, rooms × households); (3) Test degree=3 on top 3 features; (4) Use feature importance from baseline model to select best interactions (keep top 20-30).

### FE-3: Ratio & Derived Features
Create comprehensive ratio features based on domain knowledge: For housing - rooms_per_household, bedrooms_per_room, population_per_household, income_per_capita; For other domains - appropriate domain-specific ratios; Include reciprocal ratios where meaningful; Create at least 8-12 ratio features.

### FE-4: Aggregation & Statistical Features
Group by categorical/binned features and create: mean, median, std, min, max, quantiles (25th, 75th) of target-correlated numeric features; Use 3-fold CV for target-based aggregations to prevent leakage; Create "deviation from group mean" features; Generate at least 15-20 aggregate features.

### FE-5: Binning & Discretization
Create binned versions of continuous features: (1) Quantile-based binning (3, 5, 10 bins) for each numeric feature; (2) Equal-width binning as alternative; (3) Domain-driven custom bins where applicable; (4) One-hot encode bins; (5) Keep both continuous and binned versions for model to choose.

### FE-6: Target Encoding & Frequency Encoding
For categorical features: (1) Target encoding with 3-fold CV and smoothing parameter=10; (2) Frequency encoding (count of each category); (3) Weight of Evidence encoding for binary classification; (4) Leave-one-out encoding; Compare all encodings against standard one-hot and keep best 2-3 methods.

### FE-7: Log & Power Transformations
Apply transformations to normalize distributions: (1) Log(x+1) for right-skewed features; (2) Square root transform; (3) Box-Cox transform (sklearn PowerTransformer); (4) Yeo-Johnson transform (handles negatives); Test on features with skewness > 0.5 and keep transformed versions alongside originals.

### FE-8: Time-Based Features (if applicable)
For temporal data: (1) Extract day/month/year/weekday/hour; (2) Cyclical encoding using sin/cos for periodic features; (3) Time since epoch; (4) Rolling statistics (7-day, 30-day means); (5) Lag features (1, 3, 7 periods); (6) Seasonal indicators; Create comprehensive temporal feature set.

## Hyperparameter Tuning Strategies

### HT-1: Comprehensive RandomizedSearchCV
Conduct RandomizedSearchCV with 50-75 iterations on all primary models using 3-fold CV. Define comprehensive parameter grids:
- **LightGBM**: n_estimators=[500,1000,2000], learning_rate=[0.01,0.05,0.1], num_leaves=[15,31,50], max_depth=[5,10,15], min_child_samples=[10,20,50], subsample=[0.7,0.9], colsample_bytree=[0.7,0.9], reg_alpha=[0,0.5,1.0], reg_lambda=[0,0.5,1.0]
- **XGBoost**: n_estimators=[500,1000,2000], learning_rate=[0.01,0.05,0.1], max_depth=[3,6,9], min_child_weight=[1,5,10], subsample=[0.7,0.9], colsample_bytree=[0.7,0.9], gamma=[0,0.2,0.5], reg_alpha=[0,0.5,1.0], reg_lambda=[0,0.5,1.0]
- **CatBoost**: iterations=[500,1000,2000], learning_rate=[0.01,0.05,0.1], depth=[4,6,8], l2_leaf_reg=[1,3,7], border_count=[64,128], bagging_temperature=[0,0.5]
Optimize for the task metric (RMSE, MAE, accuracy, etc.), save best parameters for each model, and retrain ensemble with optimized settings.

### HT-2: Bayesian Optimization with Optuna
Use Optuna for efficient hyperparameter search with 50-75 trials: (1) Define objective function that trains model with 3-fold CV and returns mean validation score; (2) Use TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) sampler; (3) Apply to top 2-3 performing models; (4) Define search space for 6-8 key hyperparameters per model; (5) Track trial history and convergence; More sample-efficient than random search for expensive evaluations.

### HT-3: Two-Stage Coarse-to-Fine Tuning
Stage 1: Coarse RandomizedSearchCV with wide parameter ranges (30 iterations, 3-fold CV) to explore the space. Stage 2: Analyze top 3 configurations, identify promising regions, then run GridSearchCV with narrow ranges around best parameters (9-27 combinations per model, 3-fold CV). More thorough than single-stage and finds local optima better.

### HT-4: Per-Model Specialized Tuning
Tune each model separately with algorithm-specific parameter focus using 50 RandomizedSearchCV iterations and 3-fold CV:
- **LightGBM**: Prioritize num_leaves=[15,31,63], min_data_in_leaf=[10,30,60], bagging_fraction=[0.6,0.8,1.0], feature_fraction=[0.6,0.8,1.0], lambda_l1=[0,0.5,1], lambda_l2=[0,0.5,1]
- **XGBoost**: Prioritize max_depth=[3,6,9], min_child_weight=[1,5,10], colsample_bytree=[0.6,0.8,1.0], subsample=[0.6,0.8,1.0], gamma=[0,0.3,0.6]
- **CatBoost**: Prioritize depth=[4,6,8], l2_leaf_reg=[1,5,10], border_count=[64,128,254], random_strength=[0,0.5,1]
- **RandomForest**: Prioritize n_estimators=[200,500,1000], max_features=[0.4,0.7,1.0], min_samples_split=[2,10,20], max_depth=[10,20,30]
Use focused grids to explore algorithm-specific parameters efficiently.

### HT-5: Learning Rate & Iterations Co-optimization
Specifically tune the learning_rate and n_estimators/iterations together since they interact: Test systematic combinations using 3-fold CV: (lr=0.01, iters=1500-2000), (lr=0.03, iters=800-1200), (lr=0.05, iters=600-1000), (lr=0.1, iters=400-600). Run 30-40 combinations to find optimal balance. Then fine-tune 2-3 other key parameters around best lr/iter pair with additional 20-30 iterations. Finds optimal speed/accuracy tradeoff efficiently.

## Model Selection Strategies

### MS-1: Add Gradient Boosting Variants
Expand model pool with additional boosting algorithms: (1) sklearn GradientBoostingRegressor/Classifier with n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05; (2) HistGradientBoostingRegressor/Classifier (faster, handles missing values natively, max_iter=1000); (3) Compare against existing LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost; Ensemble all via averaging or stacking. More diversity often improves ensemble.

### MS-2: Add Linear Models for Diversity
Include regularized linear models to ensemble: (1) Ridge with cross-validated alpha=[0.1,1,10,100,1000]; (2) Lasso with cross-validated alpha=[0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1]; (3) ElasticNet with l1_ratio=[0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9] and cross-validated alpha; (4) Use RidgeCV, LassoCV for automatic alpha selection. Especially useful for high-dimensional or linear-relationship data. Provides diversity in ensemble.

### MS-3: Ensemble Heterogeneous Model Types
Build ensemble with maximum model diversity across algorithm families: (1) Gradient boosting: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost (3 models); (2) Bagging: RandomForest, ExtraTrees (2 models); (3) Linear: Ridge, ElasticNet (2 models); (4) Individual decision trees with different max_depths (1-2 models). Total of 7-9 diverse models. Combine using stacking with Ridge meta-learner or optimized weighted averaging.

### MS-4: Ablation Study on Current Models
Systematically evaluate ensemble composition: (1) Train all current models; (2) Create N ablation experiments removing one model at a time; (3) Measure validation performance for each ablation; (4) Calculate each model's contribution (performance drop when removed); (5) Remove models with negative contribution; (6) Re-weight or re-optimize remaining models. Can improve performance by removing harmful models.

### MS-5: Add Tree-Based Variants with Different Configs
Create model diversity through different configurations: (1) RandomForest with max_depth=10 (shallow); (2) RandomForest with max_depth=50 (deep); (3) ExtraTrees with 1000 estimators; (4) LightGBM with num_leaves=15 (regularized) and num_leaves=100 (complex); Ensemble all 4-5 variants. Different biases can complement each other.

## Ensemble Strategies

### EN-1: Stacked Ensemble with Meta-Learner
Build 2-layer stacking ensemble: Layer 1 - train 4-6 diverse base models (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest, Ridge, ExtraTrees) with 3-fold CV to generate out-of-fold predictions; Layer 2 - train meta-learner (Ridge, Lasso, or LightGBM with low learning_rate=0.01, n_estimators=100) on the out-of-fold predictions. Use 3-fold CV for meta-learner as well. Prevents overfitting better than simple averaging and learns optimal model combination.

### EN-2: Weighted Averaging with Optimization
Use numerical optimization to find optimal ensemble weights: (1) Train all models and generate predictions on validation set; (2) Use scipy.optimize.minimize with SLSQP method to find weights that minimize validation error; (3) Constrain weights to sum to 1.0 and be non-negative (bounds=[0,1]); (4) Try optimizing for different metrics (RMSE, MAE) and choose best; (5) Apply optimized weights to test predictions. Often outperforms simple averaging by 1-3%.

### EN-3: Blending (Holdout-Based Stacking)
Simplified stacking using holdout validation: (1) Split training data 75-25 into train/holdout sets; (2) Train base models on 75% train set; (3) Generate predictions on 25% holdout set; (4) Train meta-learner (Ridge or LightGBM) on holdout predictions; (5) Generate final test predictions by applying all models. Simpler and faster than full stacking, still effective.

### EN-4: Ranked Averaging Ensemble
Instead of averaging raw predictions, average the ranks: (1) For each model, convert predictions to ranks (1=lowest predicted value, N=highest); (2) Average the ranks across all models; (3) Convert averaged ranks back to values using training set value distribution (use percentiles). Robust to outlier predictions and scale differences between models. Works well when models have different output scales.

### EN-5: Weighted Averaging by Validation Performance
Weight models proportionally to validation performance: (1) Calculate validation score for each model; (2) Compute weights as: w_i = performance_i / sum(all performances); (3) For regression RMSE, use inverse: w_i = (1/RMSE_i) / sum(1/RMSE_j); (4) Normalize weights to sum to 1; (5) Apply weighted average. Simple and effective alternative to optimization.

### EN-6: Three-Layer Deep Stacking
Advanced stacking with 3 layers: Layer 1 - train 6-8 diverse base models with 3-fold CV; Layer 2 - train 3-4 meta-models (Ridge, LightGBM, XGBoost) on layer 1 out-of-fold predictions with 3-fold CV; Layer 3 - train final meta-meta-model (simple Ridge) on layer 2 out-of-fold predictions. Captures complex model interactions but requires careful CV to prevent overfitting.

## Data Preprocessing Strategies

### DP-1: Comprehensive Scaling Pipeline
Apply and compare multiple scaling approaches: (1) StandardScaler (mean=0, std=1) for normal distributions; (2) RobustScaler (uses median and IQR) for distributions with outliers; (3) MinMaxScaler (0-1 range) for bounded algorithms; (4) QuantileTransformer with output_distribution='normal' (maps to Gaussian); Apply different scalers to different feature groups based on their distributions. Use cross-validation to select best combination.

### DP-2: Advanced Outlier Handling
Multi-strategy outlier treatment: (1) IQR-based clipping: clip values beyond Q1-1.5×IQR and Q3+1.5×IQR; (2) Percentile-based clipping: clip to 1st-99th percentile or 0.5th-99.5th percentile; (3) Isolation Forest for multivariate outlier detection with contamination=0.05; (4) Z-score based: flag points >3 standard deviations and either remove or clip; Test each approach with cross-validation and choose best. Can improve performance 2-5% on outlier-heavy datasets.

### DP-3: Missing Value Imputation Strategy
Sophisticated missing value handling: (1) SimpleImputer with median for numeric features; (2) SimpleImputer with most_frequent for categorical features; (3) KNNImputer with k=5 neighbors; (4) IterativeImputer (MICE algorithm) with max_iter=10; (5) Add binary "was_missing" indicator features for each feature with >5% missingness; Compare imputation methods via cross-validation. Use best method or ensemble multiple imputations.

### DP-4: Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction
Systematically reduce feature space: (1) Remove highly correlated features: keep one from pairs with correlation >0.95; (2) Variance threshold: remove features with <0.01 variance; (3) Recursive Feature Elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) using LightGBM; (4) Select top K features by feature importance from gradient boosting model; (5) Test K=[20,50,100,200] and choose best via CV. Can improve performance and speed by removing noise.

### DP-5: Train-Test Distribution Alignment
Address train-test distribution shift: (1) Perform adversarial validation: train binary classifier to distinguish train vs test samples using all features; (2) Features with high importance in adversarial model indicate distribution shift; (3) Remove or down-weight top 3-5 problematic features; (4) Use sample weighting to up-weight train samples similar to test distribution; (5) Apply consistent preprocessing to both sets. Improves generalization when distributions differ.

## Regularization Strategies

### RG-1: Comprehensive Tree Regularization
Apply multiple regularization techniques simultaneously to tree models: (1) Limit tree depth: max_depth=[5,7] for XGBoost, depth=[6,8] for CatBoost; (2) Increase minimum samples: min_child_samples=[20,50] for LightGBM, min_child_weight=[5,10] for XGBoost; (3) Reduce sampling: subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8 for all models; (4) Add L2 regularization: reg_lambda=[1.0,3.0] for LightGBM/XGBoost, l2_leaf_reg=[3.0,5.0] for CatBoost; (5) For RandomForest: min_samples_split=20, min_samples_leaf=10. Tune combinations via RandomizedSearchCV. Monitor training vs validation gap.

### RG-2: Aggressive Feature Subsampling
Implement dropout-style feature sampling to reduce overfitting: (1) Set colsample_bytree=0.5-0.6 (samples 50-60% features per tree); (2) Set colsample_bylevel=0.5-0.6 (per split level); (3) For LightGBM also use feature_fraction_bynode=0.6; (4) Train 3-5 models with different random_state values to get different feature subsets; (5) Ensemble all variants with equal weighting. Acts like dropout regularization for tree models.

### RG-3: Learning Rate Reduction with Iteration Increase
Regularize through slower learning: (1) Reduce learning_rate to 0.01-0.02 (vs typical 0.05-0.1); (2) Compensate by increasing n_estimators/iterations to 1500-3000; (3) Use 3-fold CV to identify optimal number of iterations by monitoring validation score; (4) Plot validation curves to verify convergence and no overfitting; (5) Select iteration count where validation score plateaus. Better generalization through gradual learning.

### RG-4: Ensemble-Level Regularization via Diversity
Regularize ensemble by enforcing model diversity: (1) Train same algorithm (e.g., LightGBM) with very different hyperparameters: shallow trees (max_depth=3, num_leaves=7) vs deep trees (max_depth=15, num_leaves=100); (2) Use different subsampling rates: 0.5, 0.7, 0.9; (3) Use different feature fractions: 0.5, 0.7, 1.0; (4) Create 5-7 diverse variants; (5) Ensemble with equal weights or stacking. Diversity acts as regularization and improves robustness.

## Advanced Strategies

### ADV-1: Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Learning
Use test set to improve training: (1) Train initial model on labeled training data; (2) Generate predictions on test set; (3) Select high-confidence test predictions (top/bottom 20-30% by confidence or prediction extremity); (4) Add pseudo-labeled test samples to training data; (5) Retrain model on augmented dataset; (6) Iterate 2-3 times. Can improve performance 2-5% when test distribution is similar to train. Be cautious of confirmation bias.

### ADV-2: Adversarial Validation for Feature Engineering
Use adversarial validation to guide feature engineering: (1) Train binary classifier (LightGBM) to distinguish train vs test samples (label=0 for train, label=1 for test); (2) Identify features with highest importance in adversarial model; (3) These features indicate distribution shift; (4) Create new features that are more stable across train/test (e.g., ratios, normalizations); (5) Remove or transform problematic features; (6) Verify adversarial AUC decreases (closer to 0.5 = less distinguishable). Improves model generalization.

### ADV-3: Cross-Validation Strategy Optimization
Experiment with different CV strategies to find most reliable: (1) KFold with k=[3,5] - compare stability; (2) StratifiedKFold for classification (ensures class balance in folds); (3) GroupKFold if natural groups exist (prevent data leakage); (4) RepeatedKFold: repeat 3-fold CV 2 times with different random seeds; (5) For each strategy, measure std deviation of fold scores; (6) Choose strategy with lowest variance (most stable). More stable CV = more reliable model selection.

### ADV-4: Feature Interaction Mining with Tree Models
Systematically discover feature interactions: (1) Train tree model and extract leaf indices for each sample; (2) Analyze which feature pairs co-occur in split paths; (3) Create explicit interaction features for top 10-20 pairs (feature_A × feature_B); (4) Use SHAP interaction values to identify strongest interactions; (5) Add polynomial and ratio features for high-interaction pairs; (6) Retrain models with augmented features. Can capture complex interactions that models miss.

### ADV-5: Residual Modeling and Error Analysis
Iteratively model prediction errors: (1) Train baseline model and calculate residuals (actual - predicted); (2) Analyze residual patterns: plot against features, check for non-random patterns; (3) Create features that correlate with high residuals; (4) Train second model specifically to predict residuals using original + new features; (5) Final prediction = baseline prediction + residual prediction; Can improve performance by 3-7% by capturing patterns the initial model missed.

    "rationale": "Following strategy EN-1 (Stacked Ensemble with Meta-Learner). Stacking typically provides 2-5% improvement over simple averaging by learning optimal non-linear combinations of diverse models. The current ensemble has good base models from hyperparameter tuning; stacking will better exploit their complementary strengths. This is more sophisticated than simple averaging and has high success rates."

**BAD Example (too simple - DO NOT do this):**
```json
{{
  "strategic_summary": "Last run was okay.",
  "next_improvement": {{
    "focus": "hyperparameter_tuning",
    "strategy_id": "none",
    "description": "Increase n_estimators to 500.",
    "rationale": "More trees might help."

Ensure JSON is parseable (no comments, trailing commas, or additional text). Choose ONE comprehensive strategy and provide complete implementation details.
