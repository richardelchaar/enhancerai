# Enhancer Strategy Library Implementation

## Overview
The enhancer agent now uses a comprehensive **Strategy Library** approach to ensure sophisticated, actionable improvements rather than simple parameter tweaks. All strategies are optimized for **faster execution** with 3-fold CV, reduced iterations, and smaller search spaces while remaining comprehensive.

## What Changed

### 1. Strategy Library Added
A library of ~40 proven ML strategies across 7 categories:
- **Feature Engineering (FE-1 to FE-8)**: Geographic clustering, polynomial interactions, ratio features, aggregations, binning, encoding, transformations, time features
- **Hyperparameter Tuning (HT-1 to HT-5)**: RandomizedSearchCV, Bayesian optimization, coarse-to-fine tuning, specialized tuning, learning rate optimization
- **Model Selection (MS-1 to MS-5)**: Gradient boosting variants, linear models, heterogeneous ensembles, ablation studies, tree variants
- **Ensemble (EN-1 to EN-6)**: Stacking, weighted averaging, blending, ranked averaging, performance weighting, deep stacking
- **Data Preprocessing (DP-1 to DP-5)**: Scaling pipelines, outlier handling, imputation, feature selection, distribution alignment
- **Regularization (RG-1 to RG-4)**: Tree regularization, feature subsampling, learning rate reduction, diversity-based regularization
- **Advanced (ADV-1 to ADV-5)**: Pseudo-labeling, adversarial validation, CV optimization, interaction mining, residual modeling

### 2. Prompt Requirements
The enhancer MUST:
- Choose **ONE** strategy from the library (no combining)
- Reference strategy by ID (e.g., "FE-3", "HT-1", "EN-2")
- Provide 3-5 sentences of **complete implementation details**
- Adapt the strategy to the specific dataset and context
- Base decision on empirical evidence from run history

### 3. Constraints Enforced
- **NO early stopping** (compatibility issues)
- **ONLY traditional ML** (no neural networks)
- **NO simple parameter tweaks** (must use comprehensive strategies)

### 4. JSON Output Schema
```json
{
  "strategic_summary": "2-3 sentences analyzing last run",
  "next_improvement": {
    "focus": "category_name",
    "strategy_id": "FE-3",
    "description": "3-5 sentences with complete implementation details",
    "rationale": "2-3 sentences justifying this choice"
  }
}
```

### 5. Agent Parser Enhanced
The parser now logs the strategy ID being used for tracking:
```
[Enhancer] Single-improvement mode: feature_engineering
[Enhancer] Strategy ID: FE-3
[Enhancer] Description: Create comprehensive ratio features...
```

## Performance Optimizations

All strategies are optimized for **faster execution** while remaining comprehensive:

### Cross-Validation
- **3-fold CV** (instead of 5-fold) across all strategies
- Reduces training time by ~40% while maintaining reliability

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **HT-1**: 50-75 iterations (down from 100-200)
- **HT-2**: 50-75 trials (down from 100-150)
- **HT-3**: 30 + 9-27 iterations (down from 50 + 27-81)
- **HT-4**: 50 iterations (down from 100)
- **HT-5**: 30-40 + 20-30 iterations (down from more exhaustive search)

### Search Space Reduction
- **Fewer values per parameter**: 2-3 key values instead of 4-5
- **Smaller n_estimators ranges**: [500,1000,2000] instead of [500,1000,1500,2000,3000]
- **More focused grids**: Prioritize most impactful parameters

### Expected Speedup
- Hyperparameter tuning: **2-3x faster**
- Feature engineering with CV: **30-40% faster**
- Ensemble strategies: **30-40% faster**

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents trivial improvements** - No more "increase n_estimators to 500"
✅ **Ensures sophistication** - Each strategy is comprehensive and multi-step
✅ **Faster execution** - Optimized for speed with 3-fold CV and reduced iterations
✅ **Traceable decisions** - Strategy IDs make it clear what was attempted
✅ **Curated approaches** - All strategies are proven ML techniques
✅ **Adaptable** - LLM adapts library strategy to specific context
✅ **Expandable** - Easy to add new strategies to the library over time

## Example Improvements

### Bad (Before)
```
"Increase n_estimators to 500"
```

### Good (After)
```
"Conduct comprehensive RandomizedSearchCV with 60 iterations on each model 
using 3-fold CV. For LightGBM: n_estimators=[500,1000,2000], 
learning_rate=[0.01,0.05,0.1], num_leaves=[15,31,50], 
max_depth=[5,10,15], min_child_samples=[10,20,50], subsample=[0.7,0.9], 
colsample_bytree=[0.7,0.9], reg_alpha=[0,0.5,1.0], reg_lambda=[0,0.5,1.0]. 
For XGBoost: ... [complete parameter grid specified for all models]"
```

## Files Modified

1. **`machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/enhancer/prompt.py`**
   - Added `IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY_LIBRARY` constant (142 lines)
   - Rewrote `ENHANCER_SINGLE_IMPROVEMENT_INSTR` to use library
   - Added examples showing good vs bad improvements
   - Enforced single strategy selection (no combining)

2. **`machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/enhancer/agent.py`**
   - Enhanced parser to log `strategy_id` field
   - Made `strategy_id` optional (won't break if missing)

## Usage

The enhancer will now automatically:
1. Analyze run history and performance
2. Select ONE optimal strategy from the library
3. Adapt it with specific parameter values for the dataset
4. Provide complete implementation details
5. Log the strategy ID for tracking

No code changes needed in other agents - the refinement/ensemble agents will receive the detailed descriptions and implement them.
