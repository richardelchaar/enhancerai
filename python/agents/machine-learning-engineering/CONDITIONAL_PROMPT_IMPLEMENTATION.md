# Conditional Prompt System Implementation

## Date
October 9, 2025

## Problem Statement
The refinement agent was using hyperparameter tuning in Run 0, diverging from the original MLE-STAR behavior. This happened because the prompt always included hyperparameter tuning examples and suggestions, regardless of whether enhancer guidance was present.

## Solution: Intelligent Two-Prompt System

### BASELINE Prompt (Run 0)
**File:** `refinement/prompt.py` lines 168-223

**Characteristics:**
- Mimics original MLE-STAR behavior
- **Explicitly discourages** hyperparameter tuning over large search spaces
- Focuses on ablation-identified improvements
- Suggests: feature engineering, regularization, model selection, data preprocessing
- Fast execution, simple changes

**Example Guidance:**
> "Avoid time-consuming operations like hyperparameter search over very large spaces"

### ENHANCED Prompt (Run 1+)
**File:** `refinement/prompt.py` lines 225-290

**Characteristics:**
- Receives **MANDATORY** strategic goals from enhancer
- Each step must implement a strategic goal
- Includes advanced techniques (hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, stacking)
- Uses ablation to determine HOW/WHERE to implement goals
- Aggressive optimization

**Example Guidance:**
> "Your Research Lead has identified critical strategic goals. These goals are MANDATORY - you must implement ALL of them."

## Smart Features

### 1. Automatic Prompt Selection
**File:** `refinement/agent.py` lines 53-107

```python
has_strategic_guidance = run_id > 0 and len(refinement_goals) > 0

if has_strategic_guidance:
    return ENHANCED_INSTR  # Run 1+ with goals
else:
    return BASELINE_INSTR  # Run 0 or fallback
```

### 2. Goal-Step Mismatch Handling
**Lines 88-97**

**Case 1: More goals than steps**
```
Example: 5 strategic goals, 3 steps available
Action: Adds note to prioritize highest priority goals
Log: "[Task 1] Using ENHANCED planning: 5 goals > 3 steps (will prioritize)"
```

**Case 2: Fewer goals than steps**
```
Example: 2 strategic goals, 3 steps available
Action: Implement all goals first, use remaining for ablation improvements
Log: "[Task 1] Using ENHANCED planning: 2 goals < 3 steps (will supplement)"
```

**Case 3: Perfect match**
```
Example: 3 strategic goals, 3 steps available
Action: Each step implements one goal
Log: "[Task 1] Using ENHANCED planning: 3 goals = 3 steps (perfect match)"
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation

**Edge Case:** Run 1+ but no refinement goals
```python
if run_id > 0 and not refinement_goals:
    print(f"WARNING: Run {run_id} but no refinement goals found. Falling back to baseline.")
    return BASELINE_INSTR
```

## Expected Logs

### Run 0 (Baseline)
```
[Task 1] Using BASELINE planning prompt (ablation-driven, Run 0)
```
**Behavior:** No hyperparameter tuning unless ablation very strongly indicates it

### Run 1+ (Enhanced)
```
[Task 1] Using ENHANCED planning prompt with 3 strategic goals from enhancer
[Task 1] Using ENHANCED planning: 3 goals = 3 steps (perfect match)
```
**Behavior:** MUST implement all 3 strategic goals from enhancer

## Integration with Enhancer

The enhancer agent outputs strategic goals with this structure:
```json
{
  "strategic_goals": [
    {
      "target_agent_phase": "refinement",
      "focus": "hyperparameter_tuning",
      "priority": 1,
      "rationale": "Ablation showed model is sensitive to learning_rate and max_depth"
    },
    {
      "target_agent_phase": "refinement",  
      "focus": "feature_engineering",
      "priority": 2,
      "rationale": "Feature importance analysis reveals untapped interaction terms"
    }
  ]
}
```

The ENHANCED prompt formats these as:
```
Priority 1: hyperparameter_tuning - Ablation showed model is sensitive to learning_rate and max_depth
Priority 2: feature_engineering - Feature importance analysis reveals untapped interaction terms
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Preserves Original Behavior:** Run 0 behaves exactly like original MLE-STAR
2. ✅ **Deterministic Enhancement:** Run 1+ MUST implement ALL enhancer suggestions
3. ✅ **Flexible:** Handles varying numbers of goals vs steps intelligently
4. ✅ **Debuggable:** Clear logging at every decision point
5. ✅ **Robust:** Graceful fallbacks for edge cases

## Testing

**Command:**
```bash
python run_meta.py --task_name california-housing-prices --num_runs 2
```

**What to verify:**
1. Run 0 logs show "BASELINE planning prompt"
2. Run 0 does NOT use hyperparameter tuning (unless ablation very strongly suggests)
3. Enhancer generates strategic goals after Run 0
4. Run 1 logs show "ENHANCED planning prompt with X strategic goals"
5. Run 1's plan explicitly mentions implementing each strategic goal
6. All enhancer goals are addressed in the execution

## Code Quality

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Type hints maintained
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Backward compatible (Run 0 unchanged)

## Files Modified

1. `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/prompt.py`
   - Split single prompt into BASELINE and ENHANCED
   - 122 lines total (BASELINE: 56 lines, ENHANCED: 66 lines)

2. `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`
   - Rewrote `get_plan_generation_instruction()` with conditional logic
   - Added smart mismatch handling
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - 55 lines of new conditional logic

## Summary

This implementation solves the core issue: **Run 0 was attempting expensive operations it shouldn't**. By creating two distinct prompts and intelligently selecting between them, we've achieved:

- **Run 0**: Fast baseline (like original MLE-STAR)
- **Enhancer**: Analyzes and proposes strategic improvements
- **Run 1+**: Aggressively implements ALL suggested improvements

The system is now truly iterative, deterministic, and aligned with the original design philosophy.
