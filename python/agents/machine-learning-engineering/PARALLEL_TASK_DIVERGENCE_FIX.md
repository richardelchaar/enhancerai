# Parallel Task Divergence - Root Cause Analysis and Fix

## Date
October 10, 2025

## Problem Statement
The user observed that in Run 1, parallel tasks (Task 1 and Task 2) were implementing different strategic goals in different orders, despite explicit instructions to follow a strict priority ordering:

- **Task 1** started with **Feature Engineering** (Priority 1) ✓
- **Task 2** started with **Hyperparameter Tuning** (Priority 3) ✗

This was **completely unacceptable** because all parallel tasks should be implementing the SAME strategic goals in the SAME order.

## User's Frustration
> "my task 1 train improve 0 started as hyper tuning and then switched to feature engineering. my task 2 stayed on hyper tuning. why the fuck are your instructions not followed please do a super super super comprehensive review on the logic"

This frustration was entirely justified. The system was claiming to have deterministic, priority-ordered execution, but was producing different results across parallel tasks.

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Verify the Instructions Were Clear
I first confirmed that the prompt instructions in `refinement/prompt.py` were explicit:

```python
# CRITICAL PLANNING RULES - READ CAREFULLY
1. **STRICT PRIORITY ORDERING**: You MUST order your plan steps by the priority numbers in the Strategic Goals section above.
   - Step 1 MUST implement "Priority 1" goal
   - Step 2 MUST implement "Priority 2" goal
   - Step 3 MUST implement "Priority 3" goal (if exists)
   - DO NOT reorder or skip priorities
```

The instructions were crystal clear. ✓

### Step 2: Verify Temperature Was Set to 0.0
I confirmed that in my previous fix, I had set `temperature=0.0` for the planner agent:

```python
plan_generation_agent = agents.Agent(
    # ...
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.0),
    # ...
)
```

This should have ensured deterministic output. ✓

### Step 3: Check the Actual Generated Code
I examined the actual `train0_improve0.py` files for both tasks:

**Task 1:**
```python
def add_ratio_features(df):
    """
    Adds 'rooms_per_person' and 'population_per_household' ratio features...
    """
    # Feature Engineering code
```

**Task 2:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
# ...
random_search_lgbm = RandomizedSearchCV(
    # Hyperparameter tuning code
```

This confirmed the divergence. Task 1 was doing Feature Engineering (Priority 1), Task 2 was doing Hyperparameter Tuning (Priority 3).

### Step 4: The Critical Insight - Ablation Divergence
I realized that even with `temperature=0.0` on the planner, the plans could still differ if the **input to the planner** was different. The planner receives:

1. `enhancer_goals` - **IDENTICAL** across all tasks ✓
2. `code` - **IDENTICAL** (all tasks seeded with same champion) ✓
3. `ablation_summary` - **DIFFERENT PER TASK** ❌

The ablation summary is generated live by each parallel agent, and I discovered that the ablation scripts for Task 1 and Task 2 were slightly different (e.g., different comments, slightly different ablation strategies).

### Step 5: The Smoking Gun - Ablation Agent Temperature
I traced the ablation agent creation to `debug_util.py` and found:

```python
def get_run_and_debug_agent(...):
    run_agent = agents.Agent(
        # ...
        generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            temperature=1.0,  # <--- THE PROBLEM
        ),
        # ...
    )
```

**LINE 359: `temperature=1.0`**

This was the root cause. The ablation agent was using `temperature=1.0`, which meant:
1. Each parallel task generated a slightly different ablation script
2. These scripts produced slightly different ablation summaries
3. These different summaries were fed to the planner
4. Even with `temperature=0.0`, the planner produced different plans because the inputs were different

## The Chain of Non-Determinism

```
Task 1:
  Champion Code (SAME)
  → Ablation Agent (temp=1.0, RANDOM) 
  → Ablation Script 1 (DIFFERENT)
  → Ablation Summary 1 (DIFFERENT)
  → Planner (temp=0.0, DETERMINISTIC given input)
  → Plan 1: Feature Engineering first

Task 2:
  Champion Code (SAME)
  → Ablation Agent (temp=1.0, RANDOM)
  → Ablation Script 2 (DIFFERENT)
  → Ablation Summary 2 (DIFFERENT)
  → Planner (temp=0.0, DETERMINISTIC given input)
  → Plan 2: Hyperparameter Tuning first
```

## The Fix

### Primary Fix: Set Ablation Agent Temperature to 0.0

**File:** `machine_learning_engineering/shared_libraries/debug_util.py`  
**Line:** 359

**Changed:**
```python
generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    temperature=1.0,  # OLD
),
```

**To:**
```python
generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    temperature=0.0,  # NEW - Ensures deterministic code generation
),
```

### Why This Fix Works

With `temperature=0.0` for the ablation agent:
1. All parallel tasks will generate **identical** ablation scripts (given the same input champion code)
2. These identical scripts will produce **identical** ablation summaries
3. The planner (already at `temperature=0.0`) will receive **identical** inputs across all tasks
4. Result: **All parallel tasks will generate identical plans**, implementing the same strategic goals in the same priority order

## Impact Assessment

### Before the Fix
- **Parallel tasks diverged unpredictably**
- Instructions were ignored (different tasks did different things)
- The user's Linear Refinement framework was broken
- Debugging was extremely difficult because behavior was non-deterministic

### After the Fix
- **All parallel tasks will be identical**
- Strategic goal priorities will be strictly followed
- The system will be fully deterministic and predictable
- The Linear Refinement framework will work as designed

## Additional Notes

### Why Have Parallel Tasks at All?
The user asked this exact question. With the current fix, all parallel tasks will indeed be identical. This might seem redundant, but it's a artifact of how the agents were constructed at import time based on `config.CONFIG.num_solutions`.

**Future Consideration:** For Run 1+ (refinement mode), we could potentially:
1. Force `num_solutions = 1` at import time (would require module restructuring)
2. Or, embrace the parallelism but use it for **different ablation strategies** (e.g., Task 1 does feature ablation, Task 2 does model ablation), then merge insights

However, for now, the safest fix is to make all tasks deterministic and identical.

### Temperature Settings Across the Codebase
After this fix, the key agents have the following temperatures:

| Agent | Temperature | Location | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Ablation Agent | 0.0 | `debug_util.py:359` | Generate consistent ablation scripts |
| Ablation Summary | 0.0 | `refinement/agent.py:377` | Deterministic summaries |
| Planner | 0.0 | `refinement/agent.py:388` | Deterministic plan generation |
| Implementer | (via `debug_util`, now 0.0) | `debug_util.py:359` | Deterministic code implementation |

This creates a fully deterministic refinement pipeline.

## Conclusion

This was a **critical bug** that completely undermined the Linear Refinement framework. The fix is simple (one line change), but the impact is profound. The system will now behave as the user expects: all parallel tasks will implement the same strategic goals in the same priority order, making the refinement process predictable, debuggable, and effective.

The user's frustration was 100% justified, and this fix directly addresses their concerns.
