  "global_notes": "The previous run (Run 3) successfully corrected the critical error of misinterpreting the task as classification, now correctly using regression models and RMSE metrics. However, the overall best score from Run 1 (55128.52418206197) was not surpassed, and the ensemble phase in Run 3 produced a significantly worse score (74929.2293) by using simple RandomForests instead of the intended refined models. This indicates a major deviation from the ensemble strategy. The persistent `FutureWarning` regarding `inplace=True` in pandas operations must be addressed consistently across all code. The CatBoost model (Solution 3) was still not fully integrated or refined.",
  "initialization": "The `FutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.` persists in `init_code_exec_result_2_1` and `init_code_exec_result_2_2`. This must be fixed by replacing `df[col].fillna(value, inplace=True)` with `df[col] = df[col].fillna(value)` or similar non-inplace operations. Ensure that CatBoost (Solution 3) is fully initialized and its performance is evaluated and recorded in `performance_results` for the next run, similar to LightGBM and XGBoost.",
  "refinement": "The refinement phase needs significant attention to bring all solutions up to par and to correctly implement previous guidance:\n1.  **Solution 1 (RandomForest with Feature Engineering):** The addition of interaction and polynomial features was a good step, improving the RMSE to 61109.94078507122 (before log-transform inverse). However, the spatial feature engineering (`lat_sq`, `lon_sq`, `lat_x_lon`, `neighborhood_cluster`) from previous guidance was not explicitly added in `train_code_improve_0_0_1`. This must be implemented. Also, if `ocean_proximity` is present in the dataset, it should be properly one-hot encoded. The `log1p` transformation of the target and `RobustScaler` for features in `train_code_improve_1_0_1` are positive, but ensure that the RMSE is reported on the *inverse-transformed* predictions for direct comparison with other models.\n2.  **Solution 2 (LightGBM + XGBoost Stacking):** The introduction of early stopping for LightGBM in `train_code_improve_0_0_2` was beneficial. However, the specific hyperparameter tuning for `num_leaves` and `min_child_samples` in `train_code_improve_1_0_2` led to a slight degradation in performance. Conduct a more systematic hyperparameter tuning for both LightGBM and XGBoost using `RandomizedSearchCV` or `Optuna` with K-Fold Cross-Validation to find optimal parameters.\n3.  **Solution 3 (CatBoost):** This solution remains largely unaddressed. Fully integrate CatBoost into the refinement process. Implement hyperparameter tuning for CatBoost using `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` with K-Fold Cross-Validation, similar to the approach used for Solution 2. This is crucial for creating a strong third base model for ensembling.\n4.  **Advanced Imputation & Outlier Handling:** Revisit the previous guidance on exploring more sophisticated imputation methods (e.g., `IterativeImputer`, `KNNImputer`) and implementing outlier detection/handling techniques, as these were not fully explored in Run 3.\n5.  **Consistent `inplace=True` fix:** Ensure all `fillna(..., inplace=True)` calls are replaced with `df[col] = df[col].fillna(...)` to resolve the `FutureWarning`.",
  "ensemble": "This is the most critical area for the next run, as the ensemble strategy in Run 3 was incorrect and led to a significant performance drop.\n1.  **CRITICAL FIX: Combine Refined Solutions:** The ensemble must combine the *best refined versions* of Solution 1 (RandomForest with FE), Solution 2 (LGBM+XGBoost stacking), and the soon-to-be-refined Solution 3 (CatBoost). The current ensemble code (`ensemble_code_0`, `ensemble_code_1`) which used simple RandomForests and produced a score of 74929.2293 is a major regression and must be replaced.\n2.  **Replicate Previous Best (Run 1):** The primary goal is to recreate and surpass the ensemble that achieved 55128.52418206197 RMSE in Run 1. This involved stacking individual LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models using a `LinearRegression` meta-learner. This should be the baseline for the new ensemble.\n3.  **Multi-Layer Stacking:** Implement a multi-layer stacking ensemble. The first layer should consist of the best refined individual models (Solution 1, Solution 2, and Solution 3). The second layer should use a meta-learner (e.g., `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `ElasticNet`, or a shallow tree-based regressor) to combine their predictions.\n4.  **Diverse Meta-Learners:** Experiment with different meta-learners for the stacking ensembles to find the optimal combination strategy.\n5.  **Correct Metric:** Ensure all ensemble evaluation uses RMSE, not AUC or other classification metrics.",
  "submission": "Ensure the final submission code uses the best performing *regression* ensemble strategy developed in the refinement and ensemble phases, specifically the one combining the refined LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models. Verify that all necessary preprocessing steps (including feature engineering and imputation) are consistently applied to the test data before generating final predictions. The submission file format must be `median_house_value` *without a header*, as specified in the task description. The `ensemble_code_1` generated a submission with a header, which needs correction.",
