    "global_notes": "The pipeline successfully identified and implemented effective ensemble strategies, leading to a significant improvement in the RMSE score. The current best score of 55128.52418206197 was achieved through stacking individual LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models using a Linear Regression meta-learner. This demonstrates the power of combining diverse models. The ablation studies correctly identified key contributing factors (ensembling, early stopping) and less impactful ones (imputation method for `total_bedrooms`). The `FutureWarning` regarding `inplace=True` in pandas operations should be addressed for cleaner code, although it doesn't affect correctness.",
    "initialization": "The initial model selection and basic preprocessing were effective starting points. For future runs, consider expanding the initial model candidates to include a wider variety of algorithms (e.g., RandomForestRegressor, SVR, or even a simple LinearRegression as a baseline) to ensure a diverse set of base learners for potential ensembling. Also, ensure that the initial data loading and basic preprocessing (like handling `inplace=True` warnings) are robust.",
    "refinement": "The refinement phase successfully improved both individual solutions. For Solution 1 (LightGBM and XGBoost), the stacking ensemble with Ridge regression yielded good results. For Solution 2 (CatBoost), hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and K-Fold Cross-Validation proved beneficial. \n\n**Next steps for refinement:**\n1.  **Feature Engineering:** This is a critical area not yet explored. Generate new features from existing ones (e.g., `rooms_per_household`, `population_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `density` from `latitude`/`longitude`). This often provides significant performance gains in tabular data.\n2.  **Advanced Imputation:** While simple imputation worked, explore more sophisticated methods like `IterativeImputer` (MICE) or `KNNImputer` for missing values, especially if more missing data is discovered in other columns.\n3.  **Outlier Detection and Handling:** Implement techniques to identify and handle outliers in numerical features, as they can negatively impact model training.\n4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Expansion:** For both LightGBM/XGBoost and CatBoost, consider a more extensive hyperparameter search using tools like Optuna or Hyperopt, which are more efficient than RandomizedSearchCV for larger search spaces. This could be applied to the individual models within Solution 1 as well.",
    "ensemble": "The current stacking ensemble with `LinearRegression` as a meta-learner achieved the best score. This is a strong foundation.\n\n**Next steps for ensembling:**\n1.  **Diverse Meta-Learners:** Experiment with different meta-learners for the stacking ensemble. Instead of just `LinearRegression`, try `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `ElasticNet`, or even a simple tree-based model (like a shallow `LightGBM` or `XGBoost`) as the meta-learner. This could capture more complex relationships between the base model predictions.\n2.  **Multi-Layer Stacking:** Consider a multi-layer stacking approach where the outputs of the current ensemble (LGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) are fed into another layer of models, or even combined with other diverse models (e.g., a simple neural network if computational resources allow).\n3.  **Weighted Averaging of Refined Solutions:** Implement a weighted average ensemble of the *final outputs* from the refined Solution 1 (stacking of LGBM+XGBoost) and the refined Solution 2 (tuned CatBoost with K-Fold CV). This could provide a slight boost by combining the strengths of two already strong, diverse ensembles.",

    "The ablation study evaluated the impact of Feature Engineering and Ensembling on the model's performance, measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\nHere's a summary of the results:\n\n1.  **Base Case (Feature Engineering + Ensembling):** The full model, incorporating both feature engineering and ensembling, achieved an RMSE of **60876.9305**. This serves as the baseline for comparison.\n\n2.  **Ablation: No Feature Engineering:** When feature engineering was removed (but ensembling was kept), the RMSE increased to **61447.0163**. This represents a performance degradation of **570.0859** compared to the base case.\n\n3.  **Ablation: No Ensembling:** When ensembling was removed (but feature engineering was kept, using only Model A), the RMSE increased to **61300.2845**. This indicates a performance degradation of **423.3540** compared to the base case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on these results, removing Feature Engineering led to a larger increase in RMSE (570.0859) than removing Ensembling (423.3540). Therefore, the study concludes that **Feature Engineering contributes more to the overall performance** of the model than Ensembling in this specific setup."

    "The ablation study clearly indicates that ensembling is the most impactful component for performance, with LightGBM showing stronger individual performance. To further enhance the solution, we should replace the current simple averaging ensemble with a weighted average. This allows us to assign a higher weight to the LightGBM predictions, reflecting its superior individual contribution. We can start by quickly experimenting with a few predefined weight combinations (e.g., 0.6 LGBM / 0.4 XGBoost) to find an immediate improvement without exhaustive search.",
    "Instead of relying on fixed weights, we should implement a simple stacking approach by training a meta-model, such as a Ridge Regressor, on the predictions of our base models. This meta-learner will take `y_pred_lgbm` and `y_pred_xgb` as input features and learn to predict `y_val`. This method can discover more optimal and nuanced combination strategies than a predefined weighted average, offering a substantial performance improvement while remaining computationally efficient."

    "The plan is to combine the predictions from the three independent solutions using a weighted averaging or soft voting strategy.\n\n1.  **Execute Each Solution:** Run each of the three provided Python solutions independently. Each solution should generate its own prediction file (e.g., `submission_solution1.csv`, `submission_solution2.csv`, `submission_solution3.csv`) in a consistent format (e.g., an `id` column and a `prediction` column, or probability columns for classification).\n\n2.  **Load Predictions:** Read the prediction files from each solution into a central script. Ensure that the predictions are aligned by a common identifier (e.g., the `id` column) across all three datasets.\n\n3.  **Determine Ensemble Method:**\n    *   **For Regression Tasks or Probability Predictions (Classification):** Use Weighted Averaging. This is the most flexible and often effective approach.\n        *   For each prediction instance, take the output value (e.g., continuous value for regression, or probability for a specific class in classification) from each solution.\n        *   Apply a weighted average: `Final_Prediction = (Weight_S1 * Prediction_S1) + (Weight_S2 * Prediction_S2) + (Weight_S3 * Prediction_S3)`.\n        *   Initial weights can be set equally (e.g., 1/3 for each). For refinement, weights can be determined based on the observed performance of each individual solution on a validation set (e.g., a model with better CV score gets a slightly higher weight).\n        *   If the task is classification and the models output probabilities for each class, perform this weighted averaging for each class's probability. The final predicted class for an instance will be the one with the highest averaged probability.\n    *   **For Hard Label Predictions (Classification):** Use Soft Voting if probability outputs are not available.\n        *   If solutions directly output class labels (e.g., 0 or 1), convert these into one-hot encoded vectors (if the task is multi-class and there's a possibility of ambiguity). Then apply the weighted averaging on these \"pseudo-probabilities\" for each class.\n        *   If true probabilities are not accessible, a simple majority vote (Hard Voting) would be the alternative: `Final_Label = mode(Label_S1, Label_S2, Label_S3)`. However, weighted averaging of probabilities (soft voting) is generally preferred if possible.\n\n4.  **Generate Final Submission:** Create a new `submission.csv` file using the ensembled predictions, ensuring it adheres to the competition's required submission format.",
    "1.  **Generate Out-of-Fold and Test Predictions for Each Solution:** For each of the three provided Python solutions, execute them to obtain two sets of predictions:\n    *   **Out-of-Fold (OOF) Predictions:** Predictions generated for the training data, typically by training the model on multiple folds of the training data and predicting on the held-out fold. This ensures the predictions are unbiased and not overfit to the training data the model saw.\n    *   **Test Predictions:** Standard predictions on the competition's test set.\n2.  **Construct Meta-Features:**\n    *   For the training set, create a new \"meta-feature\" dataset where each sample's features are the OOF predictions from Solution 1, Solution 2, and Solution 3 for that respective sample. The target for this meta-training set remains the original target variable.\n    *   For the test set, create a new \"meta-feature\" dataset where each sample's features are the direct test predictions from Solution 1, Solution 2, and Solution 3 for that respective sample.\n3.  **Train a Simple Meta-Learner:** Train a very simple, linear model (e.g., Logistic Regression for classification, or Linear Regression for regression) on the meta-feature training dataset. This model learns how to combine the predictions of the base solutions.\n4.  **Generate Final Ensemble Predictions:** Use the trained simple meta-learner to predict on the meta-feature test dataset. These predictions will form the final submission file."
