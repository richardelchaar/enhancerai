  "global_notes": "The previous run (Run 2) made significant progress in refining individual solutions, particularly with the introduction of spatial feature engineering in Solution 1 (achieving RMSE 56916.8696) and stacking with a Ridge meta-learner in Solution 2 (achieving RMSE 57409.6902). However, the overall best score of 55128.52418206197 from Run 1 was not surpassed, indicating further room for improvement, especially in ensembling strategies. A critical issue was identified in the ensemble and submission phases of Run 2, where the agent misinterpreted the task as classification instead of regression, leading to irrelevant code and metrics (AUC 1.0). This fundamental error must be corrected immediately. Additionally, the `FutureWarning` regarding `inplace=True` in pandas operations persists and should be addressed for cleaner, more maintainable code.",
  "initialization": "The initial model candidates (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) are good choices. Ensure that all `num_model_candidates` (currently 3) are fully initialized and evaluated in the `performance_results` for the next run. The CatBoost model was described but not fully integrated into the main evaluation flow in Run 2. Address the `FutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.` by replacing `df[col].fillna(value, inplace=True)` with `df[col] = df[col].fillna(value)` or similar non-inplace operations.",
  "refinement": "The refinement phase showed promising results. For the next run:\n1.  **Solution 1 (RandomForest with Feature Engineering):** The spatial feature engineering (`lat_sq`, `lon_sq`, `lat_x_lon`, `neighborhood_cluster`) proved highly effective. Explore further enhancements to these spatial features, such as different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN for density-based clusters) or more complex interaction terms. Consider adding more diverse feature engineering techniques like target encoding for categorical features (if any are introduced) or interaction terms between `median_income` and `population_per_household`.\n2.  **Solution 2 (LightGBM + XGBoost Stacking):** The stacking with a Ridge meta-learner was successful. Experiment with tuning the `alpha` parameter of the Ridge regressor or trying other linear meta-learners like Lasso or ElasticNet.\n3.  **Solution 3 (CatBoost):** Fully integrate CatBoost into the refinement process. Implement hyperparameter tuning for CatBoost using `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` with K-Fold Cross-Validation, similar to the approach used for Solution 2 in the previous guidance. This will create a strong third base model for ensembling.\n4.  **Advanced Imputation & Outlier Handling:** Revisit the previous guidance on exploring more sophisticated imputation methods (e.g., `IterativeImputer`, `KNNImputer`) and implementing outlier detection/handling techniques, as these were not fully explored in Run 2.\n5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Expansion:** For the best performing individual models (RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost), consider a more extensive hyperparameter search using advanced optimization libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt to find more optimal configurations.",
  "ensemble": "This is the most critical area for the next run. The ensemble and submission code in Run 2 incorrectly addressed a classification task. This must be rectified.\n1.  **CRITICAL FIX: Regression Task:** All ensemble strategies must be adapted for a *regression* task, using appropriate models (e.g., `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `ElasticNet`, shallow tree-based regressors) as meta-learners and evaluating with RMSE.\n2.  **Replicate Previous Best:** Recreate the ensemble that achieved the 55128.52418206197 RMSE from Run 1, which involved stacking individual LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models using a Linear Regression meta-learner. This should serve as a strong baseline.\n3.  **Combine Best Refined Solutions:** Implement a multi-layer stacking ensemble that combines the predictions from the best refined Solution 1 (RandomForest with spatial FE, RMSE 56916.86) and the best refined Solution 2 (LGBM+XGBoost with Ridge stacking, RMSE 57409.69). Use a simple meta-learner (e.g., `LinearRegression` or `Ridge`) to combine their outputs.\n4.  **Integrate Refined CatBoost:** Once Solution 3 (refined CatBoost) is available, integrate its predictions into the stacking ensemble, potentially alongside Solution 1 and Solution 2, or as part of a broader set of base models for a meta-learner.\n5.  **Diverse Meta-Learners:** Experiment with different meta-learners for the stacking ensembles, including `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `ElasticNet`, and potentially a shallow `LightGBMRegressor` or `XGBRegressor` to capture more complex interactions between base model predictions.",
  "submission": "Ensure the final submission code uses the best performing *regression* ensemble strategy developed in the refinement and ensemble phases. Verify that all necessary preprocessing steps (including feature engineering and imputation) are consistently applied to the test data before generating final predictions. The submission file format must be `median_house_value` without a header, as specified in the task description.",
