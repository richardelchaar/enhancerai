  "global_notes": "The pipeline successfully identified and implemented effective ensemble strategies, leading to a significant improvement in the RMSE score. The current best score of 55128.52418206197 was achieved through stacking individual LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models using a Linear Regression meta-learner. This demonstrates the power of combining diverse models. The ablation studies correctly identified key contributing factors (ensembling, early stopping) and less impactful ones (imputation method for `total_bedrooms`). The `FutureWarning` regarding `inplace=True` in pandas operations should be addressed for cleaner code, although it doesn't affect correctness.",
  "initialization": "The initial model selection and basic preprocessing were effective starting points. For future runs, consider expanding the initial model candidates to include a wider variety of algorithms (e.g., RandomForestRegressor, SVR, or even a simple LinearRegression as a baseline) to ensure a diverse set of base learners for potential ensembling. Also, ensure that the initial data loading and basic preprocessing (like handling `inplace=True` warnings) are robust.",
  "refinement": "The refinement phase successfully improved both individual solutions. For Solution 1 (LightGBM and XGBoost), the stacking ensemble with Ridge regression yielded good results. For Solution 2 (CatBoost), hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and K-Fold Cross-Validation proved beneficial. \n\n**Next steps for refinement:**\n1.  **Feature Engineering:** This is a critical area not yet explored. Generate new features from existing ones (e.g., `rooms_per_household`, `population_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `density` from `latitude`/`longitude`). This often provides significant performance gains in tabular data.\n2.  **Advanced Imputation:** While simple imputation worked, explore more sophisticated methods like `IterativeImputer` (MICE) or `KNNImputer` for missing values, especially if more missing data is discovered in other columns.\n3.  **Outlier Detection and Handling:** Implement techniques to identify and handle outliers in numerical features, as they can negatively impact model training.\n4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Expansion:** For both LightGBM/XGBoost and CatBoost, consider a more extensive hyperparameter search using tools like Optuna or Hyperopt, which are more efficient than RandomizedSearchCV for larger search spaces. This could be applied to the individual models within Solution 1 as well.",
  "ensemble": "The current stacking ensemble with `LinearRegression` as a meta-learner achieved the best score. This is a strong foundation.\n\n**Next steps for ensembling:**\n1.  **Diverse Meta-Learners:** Experiment with different meta-learners for the stacking ensemble. Instead of just `LinearRegression`, try `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `ElasticNet`, or even a simple tree-based model (like a shallow `LightGBM` or `XGBoost`) as the meta-learner. This could capture more complex relationships between the base model predictions.\n2.  **Multi-Layer Stacking:** Consider a multi-layer stacking approach where the outputs of the current ensemble (LGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) are fed into another layer of models, or even combined with other diverse models (e.g., a simple neural network if computational resources allow).\n3.  **Weighted Averaging of Refined Solutions:** Implement a weighted average ensemble of the *final outputs* from the refined Solution 1 (stacking of LGBM+XGBoost) and the refined Solution 2 (tuned CatBoost with K-Fold CV). This could provide a slight boost by combining the strengths of two already strong, diverse ensembles.",
