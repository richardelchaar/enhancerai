  "global_notes": "The pipeline successfully completed Run 1, achieving a best validation RMSE of 56728.328 through a meta-ensemble of two refined solutions. Ablation studies were crucial in guiding improvements: they confirmed the benefit of ensembling and revealed that explicit median imputation for missing values did not improve performance for LightGBM/XGBoost, suggesting these models handle NaNs internally. Weighted averaging for the internal ensemble of Solution 1 also provided a slight improvement. The meta-learning ensemble strategy proved more effective than simple averaging.",
  "initialization": "The initial selection of LightGBM and XGBoost as model candidates was appropriate, providing strong base models for the ensemble. The models were correctly identified as suitable for tabular regression. No specific changes are needed for the model candidates themselves at this stage.",
  "refinement": "The refinement steps successfully improved individual solution performance. For the next run, we should focus on: \n1.  **Simplify Preprocessing**: Remove explicit `SimpleImputer` steps and `fillna` calls for numerical features (like `total_bedrooms`) in both solutions. Rely on LightGBM and XGBoost's native handling of missing values, as the ablation study showed no measurable benefit from explicit median imputation or indicator features. This will simplify the code and potentially improve efficiency.\n2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement a more thorough hyperparameter tuning strategy (e.g., using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`) for both LightGBM and XGBoost models within each solution. Focus on key parameters such as `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, `num_leaves` (for LightGBM), `subsample`, and `colsample_bytree` to further optimize individual model performance.\n3.  **Feature Engineering**: Explore simple, domain-agnostic feature engineering techniques. Examples include creating interaction terms between existing features, polynomial features, or basic aggregations if logical. This could provide new information to the models.",
  "ensemble": "The meta-learning ensemble strategy using `LinearRegression` to combine the predictions of the two solutions proved effective, yielding the best overall performance. For the next run, we should:\n1.  **Retain Meta-Learner**: Continue using the `LinearRegression` meta-learner for combining predictions, as it demonstrated superior performance over simple averaging.\n2.  **Explore Robust Meta-Learners**: If the number of base models increases in future runs, consider exploring slightly more robust linear meta-learners like Ridge or Lasso regression to prevent potential overfitting, though `LinearRegression` with `positive=True` and `fit_intercept=False` is a good starting point.\n3.  **Diversity in Base Models**: If `num_solutions` is increased in future runs, prioritize introducing more diverse base model types (e.g., a different type of regressor like a Random Forest, or even a simple neural network) to maximize the benefits of ensembling.",
  "submission": "The final submission code correctly implemented the best-performing meta-ensemble strategy and generated the submission file. No changes are needed for the submission process itself.",
