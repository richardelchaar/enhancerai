# Complete Fixes Summary - All Changes Applied

## Date
October 10, 2025

## Problem Overview
The user experienced multiple critical issues with the MLE-STAR refinement pipeline:

1. **Parallel tasks diverging**: Task 1 and Task 2 were doing different things despite having identical inputs
2. **Wrong priority ordering**: Tasks were implementing Priority 3 (Hyperparameter Tuning) before Priority 1 (Feature Engineering)
3. **Non-deterministic behavior**: Same inputs producing different outputs
4. **Unnecessary parallelism**: User wanted only 1 task to run during refinement (linear refinement of champion)
5. **Confusing instructions**: Priority numbers in prompts didn't match filtered goal lists

## All Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Set temperature=0.0 for Deterministic Code Generation

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/shared_libraries/debug_util.py`  
**Line**: 359

**Change:**
```python
generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    temperature=0.0,  # Changed from 1.0
),
```

**Impact**: All code generation (ablation, implementation, debugging) is now deterministic.

---

### Fix 2: Switch from ParallelAgent to SequentialAgent

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`  
**Lines**: 476-480

**Change:**
```python
# Changed from ParallelAgent to SequentialAgent
refinement_agent = agents.SequentialAgent(
    name="refinement_agent",
    description="Refine solutions sequentially (all tasks for Run 0, only Task 1 for Run 1+).",
    sub_agents=wrapped_refinement_sub_agents,
)
```

**Impact**: Tasks run one at a time instead of in parallel. No race conditions.

---

### Fix 3: Conditional Task Skipping for Refinement Runs

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`  
**Lines**: 433-470

**Added:**
- Skip callback function that detects refinement mode
- Wrapper agents that conditionally skip Task 2+ during refinement runs
- Logic to ensure only Task 1 executes in Run 1+

**Impact**: 
- Run 0: Task 1 and Task 2 both execute sequentially
- Run 1+: Only Task 1 executes, Task 2+ are skipped
- No more FileNotFoundError for `run_1/2/` directories

---

### Fix 4: Set num_solutions = 1 in State for Refinement Runs

**File**: `run_meta.py`  
**Line**: 199

**Change:**
```python
initial_state["num_solutions"] = 1  # LINEAR REFINEMENT: Only refine 1 solution (the champion)
```

**Impact**: State clearly indicates only 1 solution should be refined.

---

### Fix 5: Clarified Priority Ordering Instructions

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/prompt.py`  
**Lines**: 247-263

**Change:**
```python
# CRITICAL PLANNING RULES - READ CAREFULLY
1. **STRICT PRIORITY ORDERING**: You MUST implement strategic goals IN THE ORDER THEY APPEAR above.
   - Your Step 1 MUST implement the FIRST strategic goal listed (whichever priority number it has)
   - Your Step 2 MUST implement the SECOND strategic goal listed (whichever priority number it has)
   - Your Step 3 MUST implement the THIRD strategic goal listed (if it exists)
   - The strategic goals are ALREADY SORTED by priority - DO NOT reorder them
   - Example: If you see "Priority 1" first and "Priority 3" second, then Step 1 implements Priority 1, Step 2 implements Priority 3
```

**Impact**: Clear disambiguation when priority numbers are not consecutive (e.g., Priority 1, then Priority 3).

---

### Fix 6: Updated Example to Match New Instructions

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/prompt.py`  
**Lines**: 300-318

**Change:**
Added concrete example showing Priority 1 followed by Priority 3 (not Priority 2), making it crystal clear that Step 1 → Priority 1, Step 2 → Priority 3.

**Impact**: LLM sees exactly what to do when priority numbers have gaps.

---

### Fix 7: Added Debug Logging for Goal Processing

**File**: `machine_learning_engineering/sub_agents/refinement/agent.py`  
**Lines**: 84-96

**Added:**
```python
# DEBUG: Print what goals we're working with
print(f"[Task {task_id}] DEBUG: Refinement goals received: {len(refinement_goals)} goals")
for i, g in enumerate(sorted_goals):
    print(f"  [{i}] Priority {g.get('priority')}: {g.get('focus')} (target: {g.get('target_agent_phase')})")

# DEBUG: Show what string is being passed to LLM
print(f"[Task {task_id}] DEBUG: Strategic goals string being sent to planner:")
print(f"---\n{enhancer_goals_str}\n---")
```

**Impact**: Can now see exactly what goals are being passed to the planner in the logs.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Run 0 (Discovery Mode):
```
1. Initialization creates 2 initial solutions
2. Refinement:
   - Task 1 runs completely: ablation → plan (3 steps) → implement 3 steps → save train1_1.py
   - Task 2 runs completely: ablation → plan (3 steps) → implement 3 steps → save train1_2.py
3. Ensemble combines results
4. Best solution saved as champion
```

### Run 1+ (Refinement Mode):
```
1. Initialization SKIPPED (champion loaded)
2. Refinement:
   - Task 1 runs: ablation → plan → implement steps in order:
     * Step 1: Feature Engineering (Priority 1) → train0_improve0.py
     * Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning (Priority 3) → train0_improve1.py
     * Step 3: Ablation-driven improvement → train0_improve2.py
   - Task 2 SKIPPED (wrapper detects is_refinement_run=True)
   - Best improvement saved as train1_1.py
3. Ensemble SKIPPED
4. Submission creates final output from train1_1.py
```

**Key Points:**
- Only Task 1 runs in refinement mode
- Steps execute in strict priority order (Priority 1 first, Priority 3 second)
- All code generation is deterministic (`temperature=0.0`)
- No FileNotFoundError for Task 2 directories

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Delete existing Run 1 data:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf machine_learning_engineering/workspace/california-housing-prices/run_1
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python run_meta.py --task_name california-housing-prices --num_runs 2
   ```

3. **Check the logs for:**
   - `[Task 1] DEBUG: Refinement goals received:` - should show 2 goals (Priority 1 and Priority 3)
   - `[Refinement Mode] Skipping Task 2` - should appear in Run 1
   - Step execution order in logs

4. **Verify directory structure:**
   ```
   run_1/
     1/
       ablation_0.py
       train0_improve0.py  ← Feature Engineering (Priority 1)
       train0_improve1.py  ← Hyperparameter Tuning (Priority 3)
       train0_improve2.py  ← Ablation-driven (if num_steps = 3)
       train1_1.py         ← Best of the improvements
     2/                    ← Should NOT exist (skipped)
   ```

## Summary

All fixes have been applied to address:
- ✅ Non-determinism (temperature=0.0)
- ✅ Parallel divergence (SequentialAgent)
- ✅ Unnecessary Task 2 execution (conditional skip wrapper)
- ✅ Priority ordering confusion (clarified prompt instructions)
- ✅ Debugging visibility (added debug logging)

The system now implements true **linear refinement**: Run 1+ takes the champion from Run 0 and refines it with a single task executing strategic goals in strict priority order with deterministic behavior.
